## Useful Packages

- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) : The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs. Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework.
	- [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) : watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application.
	- [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) : package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
